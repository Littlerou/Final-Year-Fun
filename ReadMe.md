# Development of the MILP Approach to Plant Layout Optimisation, Applied to the HDA Process

## About 
This python model was for the research into the optimisation of a chemical plant layout by through balancing the safety and economic costs.
A well-designed plant layout has the potential to mitigate the extent of plant damage and fatalities in the
event of an accident. Extensive research on computer-aided plant layout optimisation has been done since
the 1990s, especially using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and ongoing research continues to
increase modelling complexity to make for more insightful modelling. Through the HDA process as a case
study, this study looked to demonstrate a novel method of allowing for the MILP optimisation of plant layout
on a non-rectangular plot area. The study also proposed a new framework for the simultaneous optimisation
of process design and plant layout based upon design parameter interactions with Dow’s Fire and Explosion
Index. Aspen Plus V11 was used to model the HDA process for data collection, and the MILP optimiser
was developed in Python with CPLEX as the solver. The results of the study showed that being able to
model non-rectangular plot areas can reduce plant layout costs by 10% in the HDA process plant as well as
improving the safety of the plant. Moreover, the proposed framework suggested that the total cost of a plant
could be minimised by operating the reactor at a lower pressure, with possible savings of £1.8 million from
potential accidents shown for the HDA case study.
